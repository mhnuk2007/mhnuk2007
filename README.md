# Hi there, I'm Mohan Lal (@mhnuk2007) 👋

## 🚀 Full-Stack Java Developer | Spring Boot | Angular | Cloud & DevOps Enthusiast

I’m a self-taught Full-Stack Java Developer with a strong backend foundation in Java and Spring Boot, focused on building scalable, production-ready web applications. Alongside backend development, I work with modern frontend frameworks and continuously explore cloud-native and DevOps practices to better understand real-world system deployment and operations.

I enjoy designing clean APIs, structuring maintainable codebases, and solving problems end-to-end—from database design to UI integration and deployment.
